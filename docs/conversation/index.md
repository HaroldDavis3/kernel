title: New Old Dialogues
description: Building horizontal conversations, indigenous to a better web.
---

KERNEL emphasises honest, open, and [sincere conversation](../../module-0/conversation) between peers. It is only through ongoing, care-full dialogue with a great diversity of people that we can nurture the kind of ecosystem which might be described as a "[better web](../../module-3)". Whatever your own goals, know that there is nothing more [valuable](../../module-1/value) in this world than True Voice.

> The gunfire around us makes it hard to hear. But the human voice is different from other sounds. It can be heard over noises that bury everything else. Even when it's not shouting. Even when it's just a whisper. Even the lowest whisper can be heard over armies... when it's telling the truth. 

## Roots

It can be difficult for technologists to understand what constitutes real conversation and why it is so critical in any human endeavour. However, we are privileged to have representatives from the <a href="https://harolddavis3.github.io/Two-Row-Wampum-Social-Layer-Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Row Wampum Working Group</a> and the historical Longhouse Council of the Five Nations Confederacy participating with us, and below you can find a summary of some of the resources they have made available. We do not need to reinvent the wheel - we only need to rediscover our shared roots. In truth, there is only one human family.

The transformative power of indigenous dialogue resides largely in the protocols for reaching consensus between human beings which have been passed down and stress-tested over countless generations, in constantly changing contexts. These protocols secure coherent and sustainable notions of community, while allowing for the creation of new bottom up structures to respond to the particular needs of any given time. The protocols we are interested in are **matrilineal**: they have been protected by our mothers for over two and a half thousand years in the undying hope that they will continue to provide fertile ground for growing a lasting peace within and between all people. Not having to start from scratch when creating sustainable and autonomous structures is a huge advantage we shouldn’t take for granted.

What is required now, more than ever, is the expression and lived realisation of beautiful social resilience in diversity. That said, we also humbly acknowledge that we can never fully express our gratitude to the women of the Longhouse in _Kahnawake_, who have kept these peace protocols alive for us to learn from today.

Before discussing the work done so far, and in order to establish some common ground, we have to start with a new theory of value, rooted in accurate anthropology. Enter [David Graeber](../../module-2/debt):

>It would also help explain the extraordinary importance of indigenous people’s struggles in the new movement: such people tend to be simultaneously the very least alienated and most oppressed people on earth. Now that new communication technologies have made it possible to
include them in global revolutionary alliances, as well as local resistance and revolt, it is well-nigh inevitable that they should play a profoundly inspirational role."

## Branches

Of course, the best way to understand any protocol is to _experience_ it by talking with us. However, we also provide here the basic meaning of some key words to begin painting the picture.

**Chief** - this is more a position of _responsibility_ rather than power, as most modern people imagine that word. If someone wants to be chief, they are likely ill-suited for the role. The original word actually translates more accurately to "the best of us", and this is a position which can be occupied by men or women. However, it is always chosen by women title-holders and requires 100% consensus. These same women have the power to "dehorn" the chief at any stage if they feel that there is any possibility of corruption entering the office.

**Hereditary positions** - reference your clan, not your immediate blood or family. Parents cannot pass down titles to their children, as in a monarchy. Introductions are made, before any discussion is started, on the basis of your hereditary clan: it is how we meet the deeper aspects of our humanity in one another. By consciously tracing and communicating the lines which lead to us, here and now, we can protect against nepotism and ensure those who represent us are truly the best of any clan, which act as containers for certain responsibilities and ways of knowing or being in our shared world. Your clan is passed down through your mother.

**Justice** - to jail or imprison a human being in Longhouse oral documentation has always been illegal. It follows that anything even closely resembling chattel-style slavery - including modern wage slavery - is unjust. Indigenous cultures across the world speak of "bringing into the heart fire" any person who has done wrong. This is consistent with other matrilineal justice mechanisms in Africa, such as those mentioned by the polymath Cheikh Anta Diop. Diop describes precolonial west African nations having intricate protocols for bringing local/regional rule benders into the family for a determined period of time — after which it was then illegal to disparage the person by mentioning the crime or that time of the person’s life. This last nuance actually points to elaborate cultural protections against free labor.

**Guardianship** - best exemplified by the Māori word [kaitiaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitiaki), which was greatly misinterpreted in the Treaty of Waitangi. It does not mean ownership or the ability to rule as the British claimed, but a kind of conscious stewardship, a _being with_ the land and sea and sky. It is an expression of interdependence which still calls for specific roles to be fulfilled by those most able to do so. Other indigenous people capture this same idea in the notion of [The Children's Fire](https://vimeo.com/20278227).

**Minding the peace** - The League of Peace formed 2,500 years ago as a response to the social climate in North America. The commodification of wampum shells at the time led to the outbreak of war. War meant it simply wasn’t safe to collect these shells from the lakes. In the tradition, war is the result of - and perpetuates - a **corrupted mind** which is content to have others work for it via control and commodification. This mind was successfully transformed by the matrilineal council that protected long term peace, right up until total colonization. 

## Buds

> Dialogue is a way of observing, collectively, how hidden values and intentions can control our behavior, and how unnoticed cultural differences can clash without our realizing what is occurring. It can therefore be seen as an arena in which collective learning takes place and out of which a sense of increased harmony, fellowship and creativity can arise.

> Dialogue can be considered as a free flow of meaning between people in communication, in the sense of a stream that flows between banks.

Establishing the shared patterns of a peaceful mind is a **critical** aspect of KERNEL. Though we cannot easily quantify it, indigenous protocols for honest, clear, and open dialogue are about _restoring our social consciousness_, which is the only way to bring about reliable peace between the diverse branches of the human family. This is not a new idea, and is [hinted at across the syllabus](../../module-0/conversation/#old-gifts-anew). David Bohm (a English theoretical physicist) and Juddu Krishnamurti (an Indian sage) also understood the importance of honest dialogue between diverse participants. The stakes are nothing less than the reconstituion of a **common coherent consciousness**, which is the only kind of mind capable of using a shared, ownerless, global state and history for the benefit of all who participate therein.

> The spirit of dialogue is, in short, the ability to hold many points of view in suspension, along with a primary interest in the creation of a common meaning.

> With this common coherent consciousness we have a new kind of intelligence capable of thinking together. 

> We must have dialogues, we must share our thoughts. We must be able to think together. If we can’t think together and talk together, then we can do nothing together. Culture implies shared meaning in which everybody participates.
