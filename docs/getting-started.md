# The KERNEL Learning Modules

## ‚ú® Transformation, not information

The core learning objectives (CLOs) of the **KERNEL Learn Track** are defined broadly, because building a better web requires more than technical knowledge. 

Our syllabus aims to build *long-term thinking skills*, provide *context and technical history*, and introduce you to the *patterns* and *modes* required to flourish in decentralized, open communities like Web 3.

The other, more specific tracks are designed to teach *practical skills* that builders like you need for your projects. The Learn Track aims to provide a more holistic framing of what Web 3 is ‚Äî its principles, history, and present state.  

The glue which binds all the tracks together is the **people** in your cohort. By connecting you with the best minds we know to teach you practical thinking skills, combined with effective patterns for using innovative tools and creating decentralized solutions, we aim to help you become one of the **people** building a new way of living, day by digital day.

We know that different people learn differently, hence the mix of text, video and audio. The "Crafted Reading" section in each week is compulsory - you will need to have read it to participate fully in this week's activities. The "Curated Material" is highly recommended if you are the sort of person who feels like they might want to add value to any of the spontaneous conversations which no doubt will spring up in the course of the work.
